# Data Science Internship Projects – DeveloperHub (June–August)

Welcome to my Data Science internship portfolio!  
During my internship at **DeveloperHub**, I worked on six practical and diverse machine learning projects, each designed to strengthen my core data science skills — from exploratory data analysis and visualization to classification, clustering, and time series forecasting.
