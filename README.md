# Data Science Internship Projects – DeveloperHub (June–August)

Welcome to my Data Science internship portfolio!  
During my internship at **DeveloperHub**, I worked on five practical and diverse machine learning projects, each designed to strengthen my core data science skills — from exploratory data analysis and visualization to classification and regression modeling.

Iris Dataset (available in Seaborn or CSV)

**📈 Tasks Performed:**
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Displayed shape, column names, and head of the dataset
- Created:
  - **Scatter plots** to study relationships
  - **Histograms** to analyze distribution
  - **Box plots** to detect outliers

**🧰 Tools/Skills Used:**
- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Data inspection and visualization

## 2. Credit Risk Prediction

**📌 Objective:**  
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

**📂 Dataset:**  
Loan Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)

**📈 Tasks Performed:**
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values
- Visualized key features: loan amount, income, and education
- Built a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluated using **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**

**🧰 Tools/Skills Used:**

## 3. Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)

**📌 Objective:**  
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.

**📂 Dataset:**  
Churn Modelling Dataset

**📈 Tasks Performed:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Encoded categorical columns like geography and gender

## 5. Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

**📌 Objective:**  
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan.

**📂 Dataset:**  
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository)

**📈 Tasks Performed:**
- Explored data features such as age, job, and marital status
- Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models
- Identified key groups more likely to accept loans

**🧰 Tools/Skills Used:**
- Exploratory data analysis
- Classification models
- Deriving business insights
